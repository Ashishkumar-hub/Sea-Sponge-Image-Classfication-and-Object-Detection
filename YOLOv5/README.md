# SEA SPONGE OBJECT DETECTION UPDATES

NOte: The dataset has very less images for the three classes for object detection purposes to increase the model performance just add more images for different types of sea sponge and train it for more epochs it will work just fine!!

You goota take a new API key from RoboFlow I have changed the version of dataset there !!

the best.pt file is the previous best weights for sea sponge detection the best weights were saved arounf 200 something epoches we can further train it bby putiing the patience parameter to 0  unbtill the required number of steps and perform data augmentation on the dataset to increases the number of images. 

the .ipynb file above is just showing the custom training of the model
